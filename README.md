# employee-tracker

## Description

This application is a command-line application. It uses the inquirer npm package to interact with user entered input to and from a database. Right after the application is started, it'll give the user several options to choose from.

The first option is to view employees which calls the function to do a query for the employee table from the database and arrange the data using the LEFT JOIN option available in MySql.

The second option is to view roles which calls the function to do a query for the role table from the database and arrange the data using the LEFT JOIN option available in MySql.

The third option is to view departments which calls the function to do a query for the deparment table from the database and arrange the date using the SELECT option available in MySql.

The fourth option is to add employee which calls the function to first prompt the user for the information for the new employee and then uses the INSERT INTO option available in MySql to add the data to the employee table.

The fifth and sixth option do the exact same thing but to the role and department tables respectively.
